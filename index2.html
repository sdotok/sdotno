tantrums are sets to the sky, my hands to the gods, to be thrown always but forever on the sly. auto pilot aloof solitude. i literally could never ever ... ever ever ... pay attention to you. unless i tried. the world is made of syrup and we spin so slow & i made more moves than earthquakes in the sco. pistachios are the pebbles, pave that noble path home. business, ice cream, some history in a cone. in-flight insight fueled by jets: pondering propulsion over bourbon on ice; touch down and to my father's liquor cabinet i go. thanks for being 3 hours late every ride since pre-school. no wonder i've become such a foolish ass fool. champagne, i purposefully play the wrong flute. hold it down for my town with my loving cru. smoking jacket on, thinking connoisseur. mathematics, ocd entrepreneur. dope in the kitchen, whipping up a storm, the pianist just sitting in the calm right before. "be in touch, go on then, continue, skate on" my responses don't depend on occasion. approaches never happen, i remain too wary for entrapment. plus i'm scary. dear everyone ever especially off center, carry on like the louis luggage i lost in los angeles. enemy lines, clipped up...because i feel behind em. i am my own worst. paranoid is the anthem. long live the most high, swag charming, so persuasive. happy i am for the weight that just makes me, thank mass, almighty, thank gravity. for holding the sky, for keeping this elephants ground on her feet. mighty elegant as i probably dont seem. i stomp but only i know what i know and've seen and do see. flowers dont wither when i walk by so i think there's no way i could be the grim reap...or sowing even remotely bad things. there is also most likely no way that bastard, the devil, is following me. probably. hidden in plain sight like cruelty, my dreams had once told, before playgrounds died, before demons were enticed by my mind and seized all control...before childhood got all foreclosed. you understand, it's realty. there is equity in this fold. i'm all in. i have no debt and one day society soon will owe me. and then i'll have all you motherfuckers over for tea.

12am, we break in. People get antsy, we spray them. I will break everything including their faces, sirens or sleigh bells? Barehand, gloves or mittens it. In high dudgeon high speed chases, untracing it. Opposite of obscure and preposterous, portfolio diversely unorthodox boxing it. Hyperspherical sophisticate it's off to the races, off the top Ebenezer $G x-mas caroling, famous staleface still glowing like poison and phosphorus, fuck the slanderous my city is a mindset, even if I am the village idiot . . it's Christmas time in it. Joy to the world when I conquer it, silver bells on my anklets silk dresses and semi automatics in my all wool trenches bitch. Happy holidays under my bed with the monsters / underworld mob bosses, sipping scotch soda eating cookies laced with arsenic. Fuck ill-wishers fuck complaints I just sing so sweetly o'er the plains. Fuck enemies I echo in this universe, angelic anger management. Holy night grand larceny, judge me I will rise then try me. Mountains in motherfucking space haven't got summits on me, and soon it will be Christmas day. Merry gtfo from sk

Yesterday was the day a month after my three-quarter birthday and marks two months til the day I was born. Many, some, kind of sum, or some years ago, etc in '91. I party, sulk. Cooly, silently and fantastically. It's cooler still, like a movie or show around here. I am...utterly transported. 
But unruffled or ruffled and even amused.
It's so obvious...the more I think about it, I realize. Have I been doing it all wrong? Quizzical, isn't it, where I get my expression. Such a permanent mannerism. A fixture, I find. Will it become manner? No.. no. A person‚Äôs nature is variegated planes...a complete apprehension of suchness. Smooth, slices of strata. Like when you segment a big mountain on a different planet and it's...actually not-rock, this very conductive, sublimated and surprising not-rock.. I'm pleased, anyway, I better begin to write, how lately, I'm writing and what I am writing, how much fun I am having and how it feels. What fun I am having. Does it somber me? Yes.. Yes. of course it does..  
I'm forgetting how to use Facebook. The way I interact with it has changed. Facebook..,,,it's changed so much also. Timorously, I am attempting making something new. .. dead ass! I invite your opinion and good questions. I want to make something invariable and indisputable. I'm dumbfounded by devolving technologies, their dumb iteration or misapplication. I am on the brink of a phase of being snobbishly uninterested...absolutely grimacing.. at accessible, mobile-first technologies. Felt my interest wane long ago and containing this view privately has been doing a number on me, makes me want to spit and burst. I don't like what the mobile-first world looks like; I wrote a website imagining how cityscapes and various epicenters might look in the future if we avoid urban planning which concentrates only on the needs of mobile users, and considers just a lot more about a lot more users. I want to work a little to elaborate these views. I get the feeling I am somehow involved. I wrote all about this involvement on the website..
Wish to say hello to everybody, all of you et alia, but family, friends, advisors from whom I've been estranged, ah relativity/relatively. Hello. Write me your number and e: ,..if you please. Because I haven't got many or any contacts in my new phone. Thank you so much.
I lose sense of who I am writing to and what I am writing. Usually it's me but I am shifting so
On a Sunday. My very best,
SK

Such a rush to see the support on my update. Thanks to all the aunties out there! 2020 has been a nice year so I would like to share a little more about what is going on and what's ahead.
Outside of getting started in the engineering field and introduced to graduate level coursework for my Master's/PhD, I have been working as an art director while shipping and shopping creative writing projects. At the same time I have been working on my "diy MFA" and taking media studies classes at NYU on scholarship. I fully designed an ayurvedic wellness practice and once I finish my 500 hour teacher training in a few weeks, I will be able to move forward in that area of my life after practicing yoga for 15 years. The clinic will open 2022, and 2021 will be all about yoga. I LOVE TEACHING so I am very excited to be certified. As a first-generation American and contemporary of India, I am very excited and while I expect to see a change in representation in all fields of which I am participant, this one is coming up quickest. In the meantime, I have been combing, taming, and planning urban-residential land where I designed amazing living and work spaces currently entering a second phase of development. Lastly, I partnered up on a Mexican food venture offering locally grown take and make at home meals for the week and it is fulfilling orders now (!), opening in July with a full menu, vegan and vegetarian options included. The ayurveda business actually offers the same order-for-the-week system but of course the food is a little different. I am also fulfilling these orders at this time üôÇ message me for more info on either the mx or .in stuff. We deliver in Austin.
I have been so busy and working so hard in so many different areas, I have not taken five seconds to stop  serving all the people and all the world around me to be by myself and just think. I am going to take a second to breathe. It's been so challenging because the things I want for myself are commitments from which I have felt too far away and afraid. It's easier to build, it's easier to do. At this moment, I'm staying still and I'm not doing anything, and I'm no one.
What I posted about yesterday is the cherry on top of my half-year, a breath of fresh air, the only thing that would ever stop me doing all this stuff even if it's just for two hours a day a few times a week: playing soccer. I can't believe it but with my doubly torn ACL, I am now a private tuition trainer for girls in my neighborhood, and the offer was born from building relationships and being an example without it even being my business. I did play soccer for 20+ years... but the way this thing came together was so beautiful and simple. Majestic. Something cool about this, all the soccer stores and businesses in Austin, Santa Barbara, LA and Berkeley have all been MALE-OWNED in my experience. So yeah I feel pretty great. The sprinkles on my entire life come in August when I welcome into the world my baby niece, codename Jelly Kaur Alvarado.
I feel the universe rewarding me right now for my eclectic everything. I am floating on my passion, steadfastness, hard work and resilience. Speaking to myself here: Sukhi, you are right on track, you're perfect. Anyone needing positive energy and good vibrations let my inner-knower sing harmonies to you. Keep going üéõÔ∏è
